# Flappy bird

Simple flappy bird-like game made in python using modern OpenGL.

## TODO

- [x] Set up collisions for game over and banana get!
- [x] Set up pipes: textures and random positions
- [x] Find a way to efficiently draw the bananas on screen and cycling through them
- [x] Game over and winner screen
- [ ] Change pipe texture and figure out how to not warp them so much
	- One initial idea is to have pillar with two parts, one for the "head" and one for the segment that extends up or down; may be more work though
- [ ] Figure a way to dim the background on game over/winner screen
- [ ] Set up gravity and accelerated fly controls
